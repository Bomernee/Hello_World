# Hello_World

I am Bomernee, I have just started to learn to code. When I was alot youger coded some basic text rpgs in qbasic on dos, so I have found learning C to be quite fast and easy. At the moment I have the vague goal of learning enough to be able to create games for my android phone. I've set up eclipse, android studio and intellij and am starting to understand IDE's their layout, how to download/instal different sdks (is that right?) through javas sdk manager(i think!!. So yeah a lot to learn!
