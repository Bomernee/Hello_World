# Hello_World

I am Bomernee, I have just started to learn to code. When I was a lot youger I learnt to code some basic text rpgs in qbasic on dos with a friend. As of 2015, I've started my journey learning C and am finding my previous experience most helpful. At the moment I have the vague goal of learning enough to be able to create games for my android phone. I've set up eclipse, android studio and intellij and am starting to understand IDE's their layout, how to download/instal different sdks (is that right?) through javas sdk manager(i think!!. So yeah a lot to learn!
